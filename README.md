# MetaNote ü§ñ
MetaNote is a web app designed for audio transcription, meeting summarization, and action item extraction. This tool leverages both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to help streamline meeting documentation.

## Extractive vs Abstractive Summarization üìù

# Extractive Summarization
Extractive summarization selects key sentences, phrases, or paragraphs directly from the source text. It aims to gather the most relevant information to provide a summary based on the original content.

# Abstractive Summarization
Abstractive summarization generates a summary by paraphrasing and restructuring the information. It uses natural language processing to understand the main ideas and present them in a new way.


## Features üåü

- Audio Transcription: Convert audio files to text.
- Extractive Summarization: Identify and extract key sentences from the transcript.
- Abstractive Summarization: Generate a concise summary by rephrasing the main ideas.
